    - **Trigger Entity State:**
      - When the entity is turned ON manually, it will automatically turn OFF after the pre-set time delay.
    - **Trigger Entity Synchronize Option:**
      - When using multiple entities, if one entity changes state (manually turned ON or OFF), all entities will automatically synchronize their state.
    - **Motion Sensor Option:**
        - When the light is turned ON manually and motion is detected by the sensor, the timer will be paused.
        - Once motion is cleared, the timer will reset back to the start.
        - If you are not using a timer, it will restart the timed delay once motion is cleared.
    - **Timer Helper Option:**
      - Option to use a timer helper.
      - Display remaining time on your UI dashboard.
      - Easily manage timers by pausing, cancelling, or completing them from the user interface.
    - **HA Restart Behaviour:**
      - With a timer helper:
        - It will resume after a Home Assistant restart, maintaining the timer's state.
      - Without a timer helper:
        - After a Home Assistant restart, the automation will attempt to reset, restarting the time delay from the beginning.

      description: Select the entities that will automatically switch OFF after the specified time delay.
        
        
        **Note** - All entities must have an ON and OFF state.

    include_trigger_sync:
      name: Use The Synchronized Option (Optional)
      description: Select this option if you would like to synchronize the ON/OFF states of all selected entities.
        For example, if more than one entity is selected, they will automatically turn ON and OFF together in sync.

              value: "disable_trigger_sync"
    include_motion_trigger:
      name: Use The Motion Sensor Option (Optional)
      description: Enable this option to utilize a motion sensor for pausing your timer upon detection and resetting it when motion is cleared.


        **Note** - This feature only operates if the entity is in the selected trigger state (ON or OFF).
      default: disable_motion_trigger
      selector:
        select:
          options:
            - label: Enable the motion sensor option

              value: "disable_motion_trigger"
    motion_trigger:
      name: Motion Sensor - Binary Sensors
      description: Select a motion sensors or any binary sensors you would like to use.
        If you plan to use multiple sensors, it's recommended to group them together using a group helper.
        This ensures smoother automation execution and helps prevent conflicts.

      name: Use The Timer Helper Option (Optional)
      description: Select enable if you would like to use a timer helper.
        
        
        **Note** - When creating your timer helper, make sure you tick the box "Restore" so it will survive a HA restart. 
        Don't set any time in the timer helper duration, use the time settings below.

      name: Time Delay
      description: The time delay governs how long lights and switches stay active after being turned on.
        Incorporating a motion sensor ensures continual reset of this delay.
        Upon motion clearance, the timer resets to initiate the auto turn OFF.
